# Angular

### Installation
- First install nodejs into your system to use npm module.
- Installation of cli module (Angular)
    **`npm install -g @angular/cli`**

### Creating Your First Angular App
 - **`ng new my-app`**

### Running Your Default Template
1. First bring your terminal to the current directory by 
- `cd foldername/foldername`
2. To run our Angular-App 
- `ng serve`

3. To run and open your app in browser 
- `ng serve --open` OR `ng serve --o`

### Important Angular CLI Commands

- **`npm install -g @angular/cli`** - To install angular cli in your system globally.

- **`ng new my-Angular-App`** - To Create new project in angular

- **`ng serve`** - To run your ANGULAR application.

- **`ng help`** - It will provide us the some angular basic CLI commands which are necessary.

- **`"ng generate component newComponent" Shortform :- ("ng g c newComponent")`** - It will create new component in our angular project.

- **`"ng generate module newComponent" Shortform :- ("ng g m newComponent")`** - It will create new Module in our angular project.

- **`"ng genrate class newclass"`** - It creates class for us with 2 files 1.classname.ts & 2.classname.spec.ts

- **`"ng build"`** - it will create our application for the production and it will create the dist folder in your directory and it we can run our application on the serve by putting that folder on the server.

### Angular File Structure

**In Angular we get bunch of files like node_modules,src,angular.json,package.json,tsconfig.json etc** 

**But we need to focus on src folder which contains all the working files in the angular**

**In src folder you will get:** 

Global Files : 

- **index.html** -  which will be single page file and 

- **style.css** - for global styling of the files

- **main.ts** - which will contain all the global typeScript code. 

In `src/app` folder App-Files : 

- **app.component.html** - Which will contain HTML code for the main app component which is included in **index.html**

- **app.component.css** - Which will contain CSS code for the main app.

- **app.component.ts** - Which will contain TypeScript code for the main app.

- **app.component.ts** - Which will contain TypeScript code for the main app.

- **app.component.spec.ts** - Which will contain TypeScript code for the testing of the app.

- **app-routing.module.ts** - Which will contain TypeScript code for the routing of the main app.

### Using js/ts code inside the HTML (Interpolation)

We can execute ts code inside the HTML inside **{{title}}**
We can use the interpolation for the class and all the attributes as well.

Which things we can't use inside the interpolation : 
- `title="newBlog"` we cant assign any value to the varibale.

- We can't use typeof, Increment(`num++`), Decrement(`num--`), **New** Keyword.


### Angular Components

It will create component all 4 files in components folder.
 
 **`ng generate component 
 foldername/component-name`**

In the default files component.html will contain only code will be `<p>Component works</p>`

We dont need to import the each and every component inside our **app.component.ts** file like react or other frameworks.

1.  **Types of Component**

    1. **inline-style component** - 
     
        we can genrate inline-style component by command **`ng generate component myComponent --inline-style`** in which we can skip css file and we can add css in **component.ts** file where url's are declared inside the [`.class{color:red}`].

    2. **inline-template component** - 
    
        we can genrate inline-template component by command **`ng generate component myComponent --inline-template`** in which we can skip HTMl file and we can add HTML in **component.ts** file where url's are declared inside the **[`<h1>This is the header</h1>`]**.

    3. **inline-style and inline-template component** - 

        we can genrate inline-style and inline-template component by command **`ng genrate component myComponent --inline-style --inline-template`** in which we can skip both HTML and CSS file and and we can write HTML&CSS in **component.ts** file.

2.  **Loading-Component In APP**

    To load the component in the **app.component.html** we need to use it like HTML tag **<app-component></app-component>** and component will be automatically loaded inside our app. 

3. Taking or using Input in the component

    If we want to use attributes to the component tag like **`<app-component text="Add" ></app-component>`**

    - First we need to initialize the input in the component.ts file 
        ```
        import {Input} from '@angular/core'
        @Input() text:string;
        ```
    - Then we can use that variable inside the component's html file for the value and then we can pass it value by attribute in **app.component.html** as like mentioned below.
    ```
    // Button Component Ts
    <button 
    [ngStyle]="{'background-color': color, color:fontcolor}"
    class="btn"
    (click)="onclick()"
    >{{text}}</button>

    // App Component Ts
    <app-button color="purple" text="Add" fontcolor="white"></app-button>
    ```

4. **Inline CSS in Components**

    For that we need to use ngdirective to use inline styline as mentioned below : 

    **[ngStyle] = "{'property-property':'value'/variable,property:'value'}"**


### Modules in Angular
Modules are the group of components or a complete functionality like **user-authentication** in which it can contain login,register,forgotpwd,etc.

Modules are not reusable but components containing inside a model we can use that components.

1. **How to genrate module** 

    We can generate module by using command  **`ng generate module user-auth`** in which we get only 1 file in folder ***user-auth.module.ts***.

    In ***user-auth.module.ts*** file it will have some imports,declarations in which in ***imports:[CommonModule]*** contains the module names and ***declarations:[log-in]*** it will contain components declarations.

2. **How to generate component in module**

    We can genrate component in module by using command **`ng generate component folderName/componentName`**

    BUT

    when we create component in some module it will declare inside ***created module*** not in ***app.module.ts*** 

3. **For using that component created inside any module**
    
    As We know...
    when we create component in some module it will declare inside ***created module*** not in ***app.module.ts*** 

    soo.. 

    We need to register that component inside the ***app.module.ts*** file and then we can use it.

4. **How to register module in app.component.ts**

    First of all we need to import that module like **`import {UserAuthModule} from './user-auth/user-auth.module'`** and we need to register that module in the **imports:[UserAuthModule]**.

5. **Using that component inside the app anywhere**

    If we use the component it will throw an error bcoz angular doesn't know the component exists.

    SOO... 
    
    We need to export that component to the angular app by **exports:[LoginComponent]** below the imports and then the component is globally available in your angular app.

### Functions in Angular

The most important point in functions in angular is we are declaring functions inside the class as we know angular is class based framework soo we dont need to use **function** keyword while declaring the function and let,var and all while declaring the variables.

EX: 
```
getName(name:string,name2:string)
{
    console.log(name)
    console.log(name2)
}
```
In the angular before 11 we didn't got errors or we was not compulsed to define the data types but in the angular 12 strict mode is on soo we need to use the datatypes as per typescript in angular 12.


### Styling in Angular
**Types of Styling in Angular** : 

- **global styling** - which we do in style.css and which is applicable to all elements we styled in global styling.

- **external styling** - which we do in component.css file.

- **Internal styling** - which we do inside the component.html file in `<style></style>` tag.

- **inline style** - which we do in inline element in basic style attribute.

###  If-Else Statements in Angular (*ngIf)

*ngIf is the functionality of the angular in which we can check the conditino inside the component.html page in html attribute `<p *ngIf=true>Visible</p>`.

it will show the element onlyif condition will true.

Types of If-Else Statements - 

- **Simple if statement** : 

    **`<h1 *ngIf="true">This is a heading</h1>`**


    in this statement the element will be visible on the screen when the condition will be true.

- **IF statement with varibale** : 


    **`<h1 *ngIf="showStatus">This is a  heading</h1>`** 

    in this statement **showStatus** can be a variable or condition in the **component.ts** file it will be visible when that variable or function will be true.

- **if with else statement(ng-template)** - 
    ```
    <p *ngIF="showStatus else elseblock"></p>
    <ng-template #elseblock>
    <p>That paragraph tag is not visible.</p>
    </ng-template>
    ``` 
    in this statement if showStatus will be true it will execute own p block else it will execute elseblock.

- **if else block with both ng-template** -     
    ```
    <p *ngIf= "showcondition; then ifblock else elseblock"></p>

    <ng-template #elseblock><h1>Else Condition.</h1></ng-template>

    <ng-template #ifblock><h1>If Condition</h1></ng-template>
    ``` 
in this statement we will give **;** to the showStatus and we will put keyword **then ifblock else elseblock**.

- **else-if in Angular** - In Angular we dont have elseif soo we need to use **[ngIf]="color=='red'"** multiple times.


- **if else block with both ng-template with checking strings or values** -
    ```
    <p *ngIf= "showcondition=='shiv'; then ifblock else elseblock"></p>
    <ng-template #elseblock><h1>Else Condition.</h1></ng-template>
    <ng-template #ifblock><h1>If Condition</h1></ng-template>
    ```
    in this statement we are checking the value of **showCondition=='shiv'** **then ifblock else elseblock** it  will check the value fo showCondition if it will true it will execute if block else it will execute else block.


### IF else statement with [ngIF] attribute - 

- **For case if with else, we can use **ngIf** and **ngIfElse**.** : 
    ```
    <ng-template [ngIf]="condition" [ngIfElse]="elseBlock">
    Content to render when condition is true.
    </ng-template>

    <ng-template #elseBlock>
    Content to render when condition is false.
    </ng-template>
    ```
- **For case if with then, we can use ngIf and ngIfThen**. : 

    ```
    <ng-template [ngIf]="condition" [ngIfThen]="thenBlock">
    This content is never showing</ng-template>
    
    <ng-template #thenBlock>
    Content to render when condition is true.
    </ng-template>
    ```
- **For case if with then and else, we can use ngIf, ngIfThen, and ngIfElse.** : 
    ```
    <ng-template [ngIf]="condition" [ngIfThen]="thenBlock" [ngIfElse]="elseBlock">
  This content is never showing</ng-template>
    
    <ng-template #thenBlock>
    Content to render when condition is true.
    </ng-template>

    <ng-template #elseBlock>
    Content to render when condition is false.
    </ng-template>
    ```

### Switch Case in Angular

We use **switch case** when we have multiple condition more than 3-4 then we usually use the switchcase.
ex : - Days of week(7),Months of year(12)

In angular we have attributes which are usefull for the switchcase as followed : 
- **[ngSwitch]** - It will create a switchcase its a initialization of switchcase.

- **[ngSwitchCase]** - We can use this on the case.

- **[ngSwitchDefault]** - We can use this on the default case.

Uses of all the attributes are mentioned below : 
```
<div [ngSwitch]="color">
  <h1 *ngSwitchCase=" 'red' " style="color: red;">red color</h1>
  
  <h1 *ngSwitchCase=" 'green' " style="color: green;">green color</h1>

  <h1 *ngSwitchCase=" 'yellow' " style="color: yellow;">yellow color</h1>

  <h1 *ngSwitchCase=" 'purple' " style="color: purple;">purple color</h1>
  
  <h1 *ngSwitchCase=" 'orange' " style="color: orange;">orange color</h1>

  <h1 *ngSwitchDefault style="color: black;">Default color</h1>
</div>
```

### Loops in Angular (*ngFor)

ngFor* is the functionality of the angular which we can use inside the HTML as like for loop as mentioned below.

**Simple For loop over an array** : 

In the code mentioned below we just initialized an array in **component.ts** file and we are itrating over that an array are we are printing the values in the h1 tag as mentioned below.
```
//array specified in .ts file.
names ={"sam","mad","ron","shiv"}

//How to run a for loop on the array and print its value inside the HTML.
<h1 *ngFor = "let item of names"> The username is : {{item}}</h1>
```

**For loop on array of objects** :

In the code mentioned below we just initialized an array of objects in **component.ts** file and we are itrating over that an objects of array
and accessing the values of that objects and we are printing the values in the p tag as mentioned below.

```
//Array mentioned in component.ts file

users=[
    {name:'shiv',password:'shiv@123'},
    {name:'raj',password:'raj@123'},
    {name:'dan',password:'dan@123'},
    {name:'john',password:'john@123'},
    {name:'doe',password:'doe@123'}
  ]

<div *ngFor="let user of users">
  <hr>
  <p>Username : {{user.name}}</p>
  <p>Password:{{user.password}}</p>
</div>
```

**Nested For loop on array of objects** :

In the code mentioned below we just initialized an array of objects in **component.ts** file and we are itrating over that an objects of array
and accessing the values of that objects and the array of the object value as well and we are printing the values in the p tag as mentioned below.

```
//Array mentioned in component.ts file 

 users=[
    {name:'shiv',password:'shiv@123',socialprofiles:['gmail','linkedin','twitter']},
    {name:'raj',password:'raj@123',socialprofiles:['youtube','linkedin','twitter']},
    {name:'dan',password:'dan@123',socialprofiles:['tinder','linkedin','twitter']},
    {name:'john',password:'john@123',socialprofiles:['happen','linkedin','twitter']},
    {name:'doe',password:'doe@123',socialprofiles:['omg','linkedin','twitter']}
  ]

<div *ngFor="let user of users">
  <hr>
  <p>Username : {{user.name}}</p>
  <p>Password:{{user.password}}</p>
    <h3>Social Pofiles : </h3>
    <p *ngFor="let profile of user.socialprofiles"> <li> {{profile}}</li></p>
</div>
```

Here we are just using **let item of user.socialprofiles** for nested array thats it not the rocket science in that.

### Style Binding
We can use style binding for dyamic styling like if we want to give the styling like colors and all from our component.ts file then we use style binding.'

We need to use the style binding **`<h1 [style.color]="fontColor" >Heading Tag 1</h1>`** rather than **`<h1 style="color:white" >Heading Tag 1</h1>`**.

Ex:
```
// Variables from the component.ts file.
fontColor = "teal"
backgroundColor=""
  bgc(){
    this.backgroundColor="teal"
    this.fontColor = "white"
  }

// component.html
<div>
  <h1 [style.color]="fontColor" [style.backgroundColor]="backgroundColor">Heading Tag 1</h1>
  <button (click)="bgc()">Chage the background-Color</button>
</div>
```

### Toggle Button or Events in Angular

Toggle event is the event which toggles some opration like to show or hide a content as mentioned below : 

```
// TypeScript Code
 display = false
  toggle(){
    this.display=!this.display
  }

// HTML Code
<h1 *ngIf="display">Heading</h1>
<button (click)="toggle()" class="btn btn-primary">Toggle Button</button>
```
**!this.display** - called negation in angular which makes the opposite of current state.

### Adding Bootstrap with single line of command : 

- **npm install bootstrap** - it will install bootstrap in your node modules.
- Then you need to add the bootstrap styling and js path to to the **build** array in angular.json.

- For CSS - **"./node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"**
- For JS - **"./node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"**

### Send the Data to child component

We can send the data to child component by using **@Input()** in the **component.ts** file and we can send the data in the properties in HTML like **<h1 [data]="'Name'"></h1>**.

- First Create the component by using the command **`ng g c child-component`**

- Then import Input in the **child.component.ts** as like mentioned below : 

  **`import {Input} from '@angular/core'`**

- Then define the input property with the Input Function.
  **`@Input() data;`**

- And we can use the data in HTMl like **`<p>{{data}}</p>`**

- Thats how we passed the data to child component.

### Send the Array of Object's Data to child component.

- First create the component.

- Create the array of objects in **app.component.ts** file.
  ```
  //app.component.ts
  userDetails=[
    {name:'shiv',age:18},{name:'Raj',age:21},{name:'Shawn',age:23}
  ]
  ```
- Run the for loop on the array of objects pass the item to the child component.
  ```
  <div *ngFor="let item of userDetails">

  <app-child [item]="item"></app-child>

  </div>
  ```
- Import the input in the **child.component.ts** file and intake the item with the input function.
  ```
  // Child.component.ts
  import {Input} from '@angular/core'

  @Input() item:{name:string,age:number};
  ```
- Use the imported item in the **child.component.html** file as like mentioned below.
  ```
  <p>{{item.name -- item.age}}</p>
  ```
- And Thats how we passed the for loop value to the child component.

### How to pass function to child component (To take data from the child to parent)

- First we need to create the child component.

- Declare the function in the **component.ts** file as like mentioned below.
  ```
  // app.component.ts file
  getData(item:any){
    console.log(item)
  }
  ```
- Pass the function with the **$event** to the child component as like mentioned below.
  ```
  <app-child (getData)="getData($event)"></app-child>
  ```
- import the **Output** and **EventEmitter** from angular core in the **child.component.ts** file and initialize the taken function with output and Eventemitter as like mentioned below.

  ```
  // Child.component.ts

  import {Output,EventEmitter} from '@angular/core'

  @Output getData() = new EventEmitter<string>();
  ```
- And now we can pass use that function in child component and we can pass the data to it to the parent in **child.component.html** file.
  ```
  <input type="text" #inputBox>
  <button (click)="getData.emit(inputBox.value)"></button>
  ```
- And thats how we passed the data to parent component and the function will print the data in the console.


### 2 way binding in Angular

In angular 2 way binding update the properties realtime and display them without reloading.

For 2 way binding we need to use **[(ngModel)]** for binding the properties.

- First we need to import **FormsModule** from **'.@angular/forms'** and we need to initialize it in the imports.

- then we need to create an property with which we want to bind the input value with it. 

- Simply just display that property in required tag like **{{value}}**.

```
// app.html
    <div class="container my-5 p-5 border w-25">
    <h3>Two Way binding in angular</h3>
    <input type="text" class="form-control my-4" [(ngModel)]="inputValue">
    <h5>{{inputValue}}</h5>
    </div>
// app.ts
    inputValue:any;
```

### Template refrence Variable

Template refrence variable nothing different than providing the id to the input field like **#inputBox**.

And After that we can acess its each and every value like name,placeholder,class,value and soo on.

```
// app.html
<div class="container my-5 p-5 border w-25">
    <h3>Template refrence variable</h3>
    <input type="text" class="form-control my-4" #inputBox>
    <button class="btn btn-sm btn-primary" (click)="getVal(inputBox.value)">Get the value</button>
    
    <h5>{{value}}</h5>
</div>

// app.ts
 value:string=""
  getVal(item:HTMLInputElement)
  {
    console.warn(item);
    this.value=item
  }
```

### Basic Pipes in Angular
Pipes are those things in angular which is used to update or modify the strings dates and all with very easy easy rather than normal.

We can use the basic pipes for strings as mentioned below - 
Ex :
```

<h1>{{title | uppercase}}</h1>

<h1>{{title | lowercase}}</h1>
```

We can use the basic pipes for dates as mentioned below - 
Ex:
```
<h2>{{today | date}}</h2>

<h2>{{today | date : "fullDate"}}</h2>
```

### Advance Pipes

**Pipes for strings**
How to pass parameters to the pipes and use the multiple pipes on the single element as mentioned below- 
Ex:
```
<h1>{{title | slice : 1 : 21 | uppercase}}</h1>
```
For multiple parameters or passing parameters we use **":"** and for multiple pipes we use **"|"**.

**Pipes for objects**
For printing the full array data which we can't print with just putting **{{userDetails}}** we can use the pipe **json** as mentioned below.

```
<h2>{{userDetails | json | uppercase}}</h2>
```
**Pipes for Numbers**
In the numbers pipes we can pass the parameters like how much values to show before points and after points like **2.2-3** it means that before point show 2 values and after point show 2 or max 3 values as like mentioned below. - 

```
<h3>{{0000223.564000 | number : '2.3'}}</h3>
```
**Pipes for currency**
We can show currency symbol before our value in numbers by just using currency pipe and passing value to it as per our requirement of symbol.

```
<h3>{{3 | currency : 'USD'}}</h3>
```
We can pass the all currency values like USD,GBP,INR soo on. 

### Making Custom pipe in Angular

Command For Creating custom pipe in angular - **`ng g p pipes/customPipe`**

Always create your pipes in specific folder and keep it organized.

After creating pipe you will get 2 files only which will be **component.ts** and **spec.ts** and our work will be totally in .ts file.

- **How to call that custom pipe** - 

As mentioned below you will get the name of pipe and you need to use that name in your pipe.
```
// pipe.ts
@Pipe({
  name: 'usdInr'
})
```

```
@Pipe({
  name: 'usdInr'
})
export class UsdInrPipe implements PipeTransform {

  transform(value: number, ...args: number[]): unknown {
    const[x]= args;  
    return value*x;
  }

}
```
- By default that return value is set to be null so you need to make it as value so it will print the value.

- **How to pass arguements to custom pipes** - 

    1. As mentioned above we can pass the arguement to the pipe like normal **pipe : arg**.

    2. That passed arguement will be come in **..args array**
    which is `...args: number[]`.
    3. You need to take the arguement value by using const or let and we are multiplied the value with the value.
    ```
    const[x]= args;  
    return value*x;
    ```

### Angular Forms

Angular forms are different than others as like mentioned below.


**<u>Most imp in the angular forms we cannot connect angular with the databases like SQL,MongoDB etc like others.Rather than that we need to connect with the database with the help of api in angular.We call the API's throught the forms and API automatically send data to database.</u>**

**Types of forms**
- Template Driven Form :- In template driven forms most of the work will complete in the HTML file only like form,data,validation etc.

- Reactive Form :-  In reactive forms most of the work will complete in the TypeScript file only like form,data,validation etc.

1. **Template Driven Form** - 

    In the template driven form we import as mentioned below : 
    **`import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';`**

    In template driven form we normally make form and use **#userLogin="ngForm"** and the **(ngSubmit)="function()"** and **ngModel** in input feilds.

    **How to create Template Driven Form** - 
    
    - First we need to import **`import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms'`** in **module.ts**.
    
    - Then we need to create normal HTML form and we need to bind its id like **`#loginForm="ngForm"`**.

    - After that we need to bind the input feilds with the **ngModel** and we have to provide **name="username"** as well because we are using **ngModel**.

    - We need to add on submit event with the help of **`(ngSubmit)="userLogin(loginForm.value)`** and we need to pass the form values to it.

    - We need to define the function which we called with **ngSubmit** in the **component.ts** file.

    - Finally as we passed the **form.value** in the function we are able to get the form values.

    ```
    //component.html
    <div class="container my-5 p-5 w-25 border">
      <h2>Reactive Form in Angular</h2>
        <form #loginForm="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="userLogin(loginForm.value)">
            <input type="text" class="form-control my-4" name="username" placeholder="Enter username" ngModel>
            <input type="text" class="form-control my-4" name="password" placeholder="Enter password" ngModel>
            <button class="btn btn-primary">Log In</button>
        </form>
    </div>

    //component.ts
    userLogin(item:any){
    console.warn(item)
    }
    ```
    

2. **Reactive Form** - 
    
    In the Reactive form we import as mentioned below : 

    - **`import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/   forms';`**
    - **`import {FormControl,FormGroup} from '@angular/forms'`**

    **Most Imp Thing** 
    - In the reactive form **we need to use the same formgroupname** in the **component.ts** file as well as in HTML file as well.
    
    - In the reactive form we use **formControlName** attribute rather than **ngModel** to bind the fields.

      Ex : **`formControlName="username"`**

    - While giving the name to the form we use **[formGroup]="loginForm"** like this and loginForm is the name of our form.
    
    **How to Create Reactive Form** : 
    - First we need to import
     **`import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/   forms'`** in module.ts file and intialize it in imports.
    
    - Then we need to import **`import {FormControl,FormGroup} from '@angular/forms'`** in **component.ts** file.

    - We need to create simple HTML form in **component.html** file and we need to give the name to the formGroup like **`[formGroup]="loginForm"`**.

    - Then we need to bind the input fields with formControlName like **`formControlName="username"`**.

    - After completing the HTML part we need to define the **formGroup** in **component.ts** file as mentioned below : 
      ```
      // Defining the FormGroup

      loginForm= new FormGroup({
      username: new FormControl(''),
      password: new FormControl('')
      })
      ```.
    - On Submit of form call the function with the help of **ngSubmit** like **`(ngSubmit)="userLogin()`**.

    - Define that function in the **component.ts** file like 
      ```
      userLogin(){
      console.warn(this.loginForm.value)
      }
      ```
    - Finally we can get the values of form feilds with the help of **`this.loginForm.value`** which is formGroup defined in the **component.ts** file.
  
    

    **Full reactive form is like mentioned below :** 
    
    ```
    // component.html
    <div class="container my-5 p-5 w-25 border">
      <h2>Reactive Form in Angular</h2>
      <form [formGroup]="loginForm" (ngSubmit)="userLogin()">

          <input type="text" class="form-control my-4" name="username" placeholder="Enter username" formControlName="username">

          <input type="text" class="form-control my-4" name="password" placeholder="Enter password" formControlName="password">

          <button class="btn btn-primary">Log In</button>
      </form>

    // component.ts (FormGroup Defined)
      loginForm= new FormGroup({
        username: new FormControl(''),
        password: new FormControl('')
      })

      userLogin(){
      console.warn(this.loginForm.value)
      }
    </div>
    ```

### Form Validation in Angular

**Form Validation in reactive form** - 

- First we need to import Validatiors like **`import {Validators} from '@angular/forms'`**

- We can make the feild required by using **Validators.required** in Formgroup where we defined **FormControl** for that feild like **`username: new FormControl('',[Validators.required])`**.

- To Check the value validation (means value is there or not) we need to create getter and we need to pass the initialized formControl as like mentioned below : 
  ```
  // Initialized FormControl
  username: new FormControl('',[Validators.required),

  // Getter For username
  get username(){
      return this.loginForm.get('username')
    }
  ```

  And after creating getter we need to apply on the error massage tag with the help of **ngIF** on **p** tag like mentioned below : 
  ```
  <p style="color:red" *ngIf="username && username.invalid && username.touched">Please Enter Valid Username</p>
  ```
  In the above code it will first check the value if its there or not and it will also check the **username.invalid** as well.

- We have validator for email as well which we can use on the initialized field in the formgroup in **component.ts** file like 

  **`username: new FormControl('',[Validators.required,Validators.email]`**

- We can validate with the patterns as well on the intialized field in the formgroup in **component.ts** file like 
  **`username: new FormControl('',[Validators.required,Validators.pattern('[a-zA-Z]+$')]),`**

  we are validating here the charecters from **'a-z'** and **'A-Z'** else if there input will be number it will show the errormsg.

### Directives in Angular

Directive provides additional funcionality to HTML elements.
EX : **`*ngFor,*ngIf,*ngSwitch`**

1. **ng g d Directives/redEl** - it will create the directive  in which there will be only 2 files will be there.

    - **Directive.ts**
    - **Directive.spec.ts**
2. In the **Directive.ts** file we need to **`import ElementRef from '@angular/core'`**.

3. In the constructor we need to take **`constructor(el:ElementRef)`** like this and inside the constructor we can write the properties for it.

4. Then we need to nativeElement on that to change is poperties like mentioned below.

```
constructor(private element:ElementRef) { 
    element.nativeElement.style.color="red"
  }
```

5. To use that directive in the HTML element we already have provided the directive name in the file and we need to use that directive by that name.
```
// Our Directive Selector mentioned below.
@Directive({
  selector: '[appRedEl]'
})
```



### Routing in Angular

Routing is used in angular for navigating from one location to another on another page in application without reload routing is used.

**Basic routing** -
 - First we need to create routes in the **routing.ts** **in routes array.**.
 - How to create routes? We just need to give the path and component in the object as like mentioned below.
  ```
  import { FormComponent } from './components/form/form.component'
  {
    path:'form',
    component:FormComponent
  },
  ```
- After creating the routes we ca pass it to anchor tag as like mentioned below.

  **`<a routerLink="form" class="text-light">Form</a>`**

- But the component will not appear soo we need to write the tag in the **app.component.html** as like mentioned below.
  **`<router-outlet></router-outlet>`**

- Finally we can provide anywhere the page as routerlink in anchor tag in our whole app.

**Dynamic routing** - 

Basically we can make the single single routes for the parents or the groups but we cant make it single single for mutiple numbers like 200 or 300.

Soo therefore we need to use the dynamic routing.

**We just pass the ID for route ad get that id in that component.ts file**

- In the **routing.module.ts** we pass the id to the path as like mentioned below. 
  ```
  import { FormComponent } from './components/form/form.component'

  const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path:'form/:id',
    component:FormComponent
  }
  ```

- Now we can pass the id with the route like 

  **`<a routerLink="form/30" class="mx-3">Form-30</a>`**.

- **How to get the passed ID's**
  - In the constructor we need to give the route like 
  
    **`constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute)`**.
  - Then we can print the id in the console like 

    **console.warn(this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id'))**.
  
**404 Page in Routing** - 
  
  When we accidently hit the invalid URL to our webpage then the 404 error occurs.

  We need to route the all URL's to the webpage which we created for 404 Page.

  We can route all the wrong URL's with help of wild card route which is mentioned below : 
  ```
  // Wild card routing for 404 page.
  path:'**',
  component:AppComponent
  ```
**Child Routing** - 

Child routing is the concept in which there are pages available which are already routed and we need to route that page as well soo we need to use child routing.

- For Child routing we need to create **childerns [array]** in the main component rout and in the childerns array there will be objects of the child routes as like mentioned below.

  Ex : 
  ```
  const routes: Routes = [
    {
      path:'form',
      component:FormComponent,

      children:[
        {
          path:'reactive-form',
          component:ReactiveFormComponent
        }
      ]
    }
  ```
- After that we need to give that child links in the main **component.html** file like this.
  ```
  <a routerLink="reactive-form" class="text-light">Reactive-Form</a>
  ```
- And Most important we need to create **router-outlet** in the **parent comopnent.html** file.

- And Thats how we have routed our child components as well in the parent components.

### Service in Angular

Service are the classes in which data,functions and class can be there and we can use or share the same data or functions in multiple components its called as service.

If we want to use the function,or the same data in multiple components rather than declaring in each and every file we can create service and we can import it in mutiple files and components.

**Best practice of data and functions transfer in angular is service.**

- We can create service by commmand :

  **`ng g service services/userData`**

- We get the 2 files only **service.ts** and **service.spec.ts.**

- We need to define the data or function  like mentioned below.
  ```
  // Function which returns the array of objects containing data.

  userData(){
    return [
      {name:'shiv',age:'21',email:'shiv@test.com'},
      {name:'swapnali',age:'19',email:'swapa@test.com'},
      {name:'shru',age:'20',email:'shru@test.com'},
      {name:'sanj',age:'22',email:'sanj@test.com'}
    ]
  }
  ```
  - Then we need to import that service in **component.ts** file and intialize it in constructor as like mentioned below.

  ```
  // Importing service in component.ts
  import { UserDataService } from './services/user-data.service';

  // Initializing it in constructor
  constructor(private users:UserDataService){
      console.warn(users.userData())
      this.usersArray=users.userData();
  }
  ```
  we have assigned that data to an array and we can display that array on the screen by running for loop on it.

  - Finally If we want to use that service in multiple components we need to follow this same process in those components.

### Get data from API and display

  As we know angular cannot directly connect to databse soo we interact with API.

  - First create service in services folder.

  - First we need to import **HttpClient** and **HttpClientsModule** in **service.ts** and **module.ts**.

    **`import {HttpClient} from '@angular/common/http'`**

    **`import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';`**

  - Initialize **HttpClient** it in the constructor of **service.ts**.
    **`constructor(private http:HttpClient) {}`**

  - **Call the get function of http with the server link as like mentioned below.**
  **`this.http.get(this.url)`**

  - Import the service in **component.ts** file and intialize it as well as like mentioned below.
  **`constructor(private userData:UsersDataService){}`**

  - **How to Fetch the data from the service Now?**
    - Call the component.ts(Initializer).service.ts(Initializer).subscribe(()=>{
      console.warn(data)
    }) as like mentioned below :

    ```
    users:any;
    constructor(private userData:UsersDataService){
    userData.users().subscribe((data)=>{
      this.users=data
      console.warn("users Data is =>",this.users)
    })
    ```

### Post the Data to API

 - First create service in services folder.

  - First we need to import **HttpClient** and **HttpClientsModule** in **service.ts** and **module.ts**.

    **`import {HttpClient} from '@angular/common/http'`**

    **`import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';`**

  - Initialize **HttpClient** it in the constructor of **service.ts**.
    **`constructor(private http:HttpClient) {}`**

  - **Call the post function of http with the server link as like mentioned below.**
  **`this.http.post(this.url)`**

  - Import the service in **component.ts** file and intialize it as well as like mentioned below.
  **`constructor(private userData:UsersDataService){}`**

  - **How to Post the data from the service Now?**
    - Call the component.ts(Initializer).service.ts(Initializer).subscribe(()=>{
      console.warn(data)
    }) as like mentioned below and :

    ```
    users:any;
    constructor(private userData:UsersDataService){
    userData.users().subscribe((data)=>{
      this.users=data
      console.warn("users Data is =>",this.users)
    })

    // Make the post data function and make call to addUser function which is made in service.ts

    postData(item:userType){
    console.log(item)
    this.userData.addUser(item).subscribe((result)=>{
      console.log(result)
    })
    ```

### Model (Interface) in Angular

Model is nothing but the **Interface** to define the datatype of an object.

We can create the file for the interface and we can define the model/interface in the file like menioned below : 
```
// This is the feature of typescript
export interface userType{
    name:string,
    age:number,
    email:string,
    id:number
}
```

After initializing the interface we can use it anywhere in the application by just simply importing **import { userType } from './userType';** interface like this.


### Module and Routing Recap

**Creating Module and Using the component** - 

- First create module with the command **ng g m userLogin**

- Then we need to create the components within that.
  **ng g c userLogin/signup**,**ng g c userLogin/signout**

- Then we need to export the components in the **userLogin.ts** file.

- For using the components which made in userLogin module we need to import **import {userLogin} from '../userLogin'**

- And we can use the components in the **app.ts**.

**Routing the components which created through module** - 

- We need to import the components in **app.routing.module.ts** file.

- Then In the **routes[]** we need to create the routes for the both of the components.

- After that we need to provide the routes in the **app.ts** in 

  **`<a RouterLink="login">Login-Component</a>`** and we are done with the routing as well.

### Module Routing in Angular

  Main purpose of routing module is we dont want to load the all routes while start of the app soo we can create the routes in routes under specific module soo while only using userlogin module only the routes will be loaded.

  **Creating Module and exporting components :**
  - We can create module with routing file with the command **`ng g m admin --routing `**.

  - We can create the routing file manually by creating the dummy file which will contain same code as **app-routing.ts** but we just need to change **.forRoot** to **.forChild**.

  - After that we need to create the components inside the module like 
  
    **`ng g c admin/login`** AND **`ng g c admin/signup`**

  - We need to export that component globally in application in **module.ts** file.

  - We can use the components now globally.

  **Routing the components in module** : 

  - Firstly we need to import the components in **module.routing.ts** file and we need to create routes for them in **Routes[]** routes array.

  **Using that routing in app-component** : 
  - For using that module routing in our **app-component**
  
     **we need to import the module in app.module.ts file.**

Hence And we can use the routes defined in **module.routing.ts** file in app component.

### Group Routing in Angular

**Why we need Group Routing** : If we have 2 modules and we have same components in the both then it will problematic while routing the same component soo we need the group routing in which with routes we pass the module as well with it soo it looks like **admin/login** and **User/login**.


### Lazy Loading in Angular (Module)
  
  Lazy basically applies on the routing,Normally if we have mutiple routes it will load at the start in First load and it can take a lot time soo to avoid that we load the components and routes as per our need.
  
  We can optimize the code by using lazy loading and performace and the render time with the use of lazy loading.

  - First we need to create a module and 2 components under that module.

  - We need to route that components in the **module-routings.ts** and after completing everything.

  **Most Imp thing : Dont load the <u>module.ts</u> in app.module.ts. We are going to import it throght the app.routing.ts file.**

  **To load the module through app-routing.ts file on specific routes :**

  - In the routes define the path and use the **loadchildern()** function which takes arrow function and the module name, path like mentioned below.

  ```
  Routes = 
  [
    {
      path:'admin',
      loadchildern()=>import ('./Modules/admin/admin.module').then(mod=>mod.AdminModule)
    }
  ]
  ```
  Soo it will load the **adminmodule** only when route will be **/admin/**.

  **<u>In the lazy loading we dont need to use the group routing like we dont need to pass the components as the childern as like group routing...We can directly pass them weather if it will be same name but we already going to rule that things in app.module.ts while lazy loading modules with the help of loadchildern function.</u>**

### Lazy Loading of Component

When we have multiple components in our angular application we there is no need of loading all the components at the first load soo it can consume your time and more render time sooo for code optimization and faster response and render time we use Lazy loading in components.

- First we need to import 2 most important things **ViewContainerRef** and **ComponentFactoryResolver** in our app.component.ts file as like mentioned below.

- We need to intialize this both in constructor as like mentioned below.
```
  constructor(private vcr:ViewContainerRef,private cfr:ComponentFactoryResolver)
```
- Then we need to clear the container.
**`this.vcr.clear()`**

- Then import the component as like mentioned below.
```
const {TodoListComponent} = await import('./components/todo-list/todo-list.component')
```

- Then create the component and resoleve its factory by initializing the component in the **resolveFactory(component)**.
```
this.vcr.createComponent(
      this.cfr.resolveComponentFactory(TodoListComponent)
    )
```
- Thats how we created the component on the button click.



### Automation testing in Angular

**Manual Testing** :- Basically manual testing is the thing where a person tests your angular application step by step like he checks the login,signup,webflow,clicks,and all.

**Automation Testing** :- If your application is too big manual tesrting can take upto 3-4 days rather than that we have automation testing in which we write some code which tests our full application in just few minutes.

**Types of automation testing** :-

- Unit Test case : This is the testing in which we test some specific or some important functions of our angular app.

- Integration testing : This is the testing in which we test the functionality as well as the dependencies regarding to it.

- End-To-End Testing : In the end to end testing our application gets fully tested end to end.

**Angular Automation Testing** : 

1. Protactor - Run Test case on browser.

2. Jasmine - Testing Enviornment, Run spec file for the latest test case.

3. Karma - Run test case in Multiple browser. (Karma.config.json)


### Angular Testing

**To check the default test cases** - **`ng test`**


### API Integration Angular

1. Set base url and version in enviornment.ts and enviornment.prod.ts file. Take the api links till the api(baes url) and concate with it version and further reuired end points and path.

2.
