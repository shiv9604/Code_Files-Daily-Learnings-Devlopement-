# Algorithms
Algorithms are the solutions to solve the problems by breaking down problem into subproblem and implementing step by step solution for smaller problems and achieving solution for larger problem.

### Kaden's Algorithm
Kaden's algorithm is dynamic programming approach algorithm for solving subarray max and min problem.
