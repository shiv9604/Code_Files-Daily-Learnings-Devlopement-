# In python there is not a specific data structure as arrays soo...
# We lists are used as arrays in python.
''' 
1.We just have to remember we should chhose append and pop opration for addition and removal
2.Bcoz if we use remove and insert function it works as :

for insert : it will shift all the data 1+ position in the memory and after that it adds the item to that index...
for remove : it will shift all the data -1 position in the memory to fill that empty space in the memories..
