We use JSX in the javascript

jsx is mostly 98% html and some of javascript

* Changes in the jsx

1. class = className (we need to put classname for the class in html)

2. We define the js out of the <></>.

3. And we use that js inside the html tags by {js} putting inside the curlybraces.

4. We need to give the closing to the each and every tag which are not closing tags in the HTML. by giving <img />

5. In the image tag we give the src inside {app.png} inside the curly braces.

6. node_modules folder we can delete and we dont give that folder to anyone...it will be automatically installed on client side by package.json.

7. for = HtmlFor

8. tabIndex = tabCapitalizeIndex     

9. Props = We can set values to that props like title = "abs" For (props.title)

10. Proptypes = Proptypes where we define the datatype of props.

11. deaultprops = Where we set the default values to the props when we dont give any value to the props default will render.

12. state = we cant manupluate variable directly in the react soo we use states for that.

13.First We import state from react {useState}

 state  = const[text,setText] = useState("Enter the text here");

so when we want to change the text we need to use setText('text') function.

14. Hooks are the compnents by which we can use the components of class without using the class.

15. onclick = onClick (To call any function on click)

16. onchange = it will call a function after the state of the objects Changes and we get a free element as well which will be event.
